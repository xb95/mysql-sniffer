MySQL Query Sniffer

This program uses libpcap to capture and analyze packets destined for a MySQL
server.  With a variety of command line options, you can tune the output to
show a variety of outputs, such as:

    * top N queries since you started running the program
    * top N queries every X seconds (sliding window)
    * all queries (sanitized or not)

There are other options useful for tuning the output to your specifications.
Please see the application help and play with it.

To compile, you need the Go compiler (http://golang.org) as well as the gopcap
library (https://github.com/akrennmair/gopcap) compiled and installed where go
can find it.
